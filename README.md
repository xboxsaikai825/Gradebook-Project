# Gradebook Project

This program calculates the final grade percentage of all assignments according to a grading scale. Users can add, delete or modify assignments which will be saved to a csv file.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** c++

Each assignment is organized in a binary search tree where the program writes its data to a csv file. The program will read the csv file on start and access each grade from the assignment. The final grade is calculated by summing the products of each grade section by its weight. 

## Lessons Learned:

The main point of this project is to learn new data structures and how they are implemented. I learned how binary search trees are implemented and how to work with them for future coding projects.
